  <section|Introduction>

  There was a time in the 1830s when medical students were faced with
  bewildering choices between more laboratory science or more clinical
  practice (Bonner, 1995). Two hundred years have passed, and there are still
  disagreements on when and how clinical education should be carried out. One
  of the most controversial examples is early clinical exposure (ECE).

  <subsection|Background: medical education programs>

  Typical medical education is comprised of two stages: the pre-clinical
  stage and the clinical stage. In the pre-clinical stage, students learn
  numerous subjects in basic sciences, such as physiology; pharmacology;
  biochemistry; genetics; medical sociology; pathology; immunology; anatomy;
  neuroscience as well as humanities, e.g. medical ethics and patient
  communication. In the clinical stage, students gain practical experience in
  diagnosis and hospital management in a clinical setting. It's also the
  period to develop a deeper understanding of certain attractive areas. See
  [10][14][18] for syllabus from websites.

  Most medical departments of universities in Europe and the U.S. provide a
  4-year M.D. (doctor of medicine) program for graduate students, with 2-year
  basic sciences and 2-year integrated clinical courses. Applicators do not
  need to major in medicine in their undergraduate years, but due to the
  limited time for teachers to teach foundational materials, they are
  required to have experience in biology, chemistry, math, and physics. See
  [10][14][18] for programs and requirements.

  In China, undergraduate programs are more common. According to Wang (2021),
  \P5+3\Q is the main form, with 5 years of undergraduate study and 3 years
  of M.M. (master of medicine) program. 8-year programs are exploration,
  which guarantees a bachelor's and doctor's degree. Similar to the M.D.
  programs and Ba's class at Zhejiang University, Peking Union Medical
  College launched a new \P4+4\Q program in 2018, which was considered a good
  starting point for structural reform (Wang et al., 2019). Table 1 shows the
  different programs adopted in China.

  The end of the program doesn't necessarily imply the end of the learning
  process. Some students with bachelor's degrees choose to study for a
  doctor's degree. To work in a hospital, an internship is a must. In China,
  standardized residency training (SRT) can take up to 3 years.

  <subsection|Early Clinical Exposure>

  A problem in traditional medical education programs is the gap between
  basic science and clinical practice. This can lead to a lack of interest in
  the first two years and low effectiveness of teaching. To address the
  problem, early clinical exposure (ECE), sometimes called early clinical
  experience or early patient encounter is becoming increasingly popular.
  Research shows that 4 in 5 universities in Europe include ECE in their
  curricula (Ba�ak et al., 2009). In India, a\<#FB05\>er the Medical
  Council of India suggested ECE in the first year of 2015, numerous studies
  and implementations emerged.

  Briefly, ECE refers to vertically integrated practical experience in the
  early years of medical education. The definition of ECE varies in the
  literature, as articles about ECE are not interested in formulating an
  accurate definition generally. However, a widely accepted one is available
  from Dornan et al. (2005), where ECE is defined as an \Pauthentic human
  contact in a social or clinical context that enhances the learning of
  health, illness and/or disease, and the role of the health professional\Q
  (p. 93), occurring in the early or preclinical years of undergraduate
  education. Two aspects are important in this definition: 1. \Pauthentic
  human\Q, which excludes activities with only simulated patients; 2.
  \Pclinical or social contexts\Q, which exclude activities in labs or
  classrooms.

  There have been many objectives of ECE and many methods to implement ECE.
  Objectives include medical practice, clinical skills, communication skills,
  patients' perspectives, professionalism, national health services,
  visualize anatomy and inspiring students, methods include observation,
  small group teaching, bedside teaching, written assignments, videotaping,
  case-based learning and lectures. (Ba�ak et al., 2009).

  Studies have proven that ECE has positive effects on the study of anatomy,
  geriatric medicine, palliative care and more. There is an increase in the
  degree of mastery, student's interest and attitudes towards the curricula
  (MacLeod et al., 2003; Gune et al., 2020; Duque et al., 2003; Johnson et
  al., 1998). However, challenges exist. Considering that the number of
  students in a grade usually exceeds 100 due to the admission policies, ECE
  requires a great number of resources and effort, which imposes pressure on
  organizers. More seriously, If not well prepared, ECE has no or even
  negative effect, that is, students without enough confidence tend to
  interact less with the environment and get lost (Al Khathlan et al., 2021).
  The disagreements in the literature motivate us to evaluate the
  effectiveness of ECE more reasonably.
